Rachel's Table (RT) has concluded that food collected by their rescue, gleaning, & purchase programs is not being "distributed equally" among their associated agencies. The goal of this project is to understand RT's equity related concerns and goals, model the characteristics of agencies, donors and drivers, and then automatically calculate a fair efficient and feasible dispatch strategy. This means using RT's data to model preferences, food availability by type and other relevant characteristics. To generate quality routes we employ fair and efficient allocation theory as well as online bipartite matching to assign routes. The resulting tool outputs a feasible set of routes for each of RT volunteer driver that results in generally equitable and efficient allocation of donated food. It is expected that this program can easily be updated with new donor and agency data by RT so that dispatchers can generate a new set of routes each month.
